# MontyHallSimulation
Simulation for Monty Hall's problem, calculatig probabilities.
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990.

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Vos Savant's response was that the contestant should switch to the other door.[3] Under the standard assumptions, the switching strategy has a 
2
/
3
 probability of winning the car, while the strategy that remains with the initial choice has only a 
1
/
3
 probability.

When the player first makes their choice, there is a 
2
/
3
 chance that the car is behind one of the doors not chosen. This probability does not change after the host reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors. When the host provides information about the 2 unchosen doors (revealing that one of them does not have the car behind it), the 
2
/
3
 chance of the car being behind one of the unchosen doors rests on the unchosen and unrevealed door, as opposed to the 
1
/
3
 chance of the car being behind the door the contestant chose initially.




Under the standard assumptions, the probability of winning the car after switching is 
2
/
3


The key to this solution is the behavior of the host. Ambiguities in the Parade version do not explicitly define the protocol of the host. However, Marilyn vos Savant's solution printed alongside Whitaker's question implies, and both Selven and vos Savant explicitly define, the role of the host as follows:

   **The host must always open a door that was not picked by the contestant.**

   **The host must always open a door to reveal a goat and never the car.**

   **The host must always offer the chance to switch between the originally chosen door and the remaining closed door.**

When any of these assumptions is varied, it can change the probability of winning by switching doors as detailed in the section below. It is also typically presumed that the car is initially hidden randomly behind the doors and that, if the player initially picks the car, then the host's choice of which goat-hiding door to open is random. Some authors, independently or inclusively, assume that the player's initial choice is random as well.
